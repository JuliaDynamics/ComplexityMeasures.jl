# CHANGELOG

Changelog is kept with respect to version 0.11 of Entropies.jl. From version v2.0 onwards, this package has been renamed to ComplexityMeasures.jl.

## 2.0

The API for Entropies.jl has been completely overhauled, and the package has been renamed to ComplexityMeasures.jl.
Along with the overhaul comes a massive amount of new features, an entirely new API, extendable and educative code, dedicated documentation pages, and more!

We believe it is best to learn all of this by visiting the online documentation.

We tried our best to keep pre-2.0 functions working and throw deprecation warnings.
If we missed code that should be working, let us know by opening an issue.

### Major changes

- Common generic interface function `entropy`, `entropy_normalized` and `maximum` (maximum entropy) that dispatches on different definitions of entropies (e.g `Renyi()` `Shannon()`, `Tsallis()`) and estimated probabilities.
- Convenience functions for common entropies, such as permutation entropy and dispersion entropy still exist.
- New interface `DifferentialEntropyEstimator` that is also used in `entropy`.
- The `base` of the entropy is now a field of the `EntropyDefinition` type, not the estimator.
- An entirely new section of entropy-like complexity measures, such as the reverse dispersion entropy.
- Many new estimators, such as `SpatialPermutation` and `PowerSpectrum`.
- Check the online documentation for a comprehensive overview of the changes.

### Minor changes
- No more deprecation warnings for using the old keyword `Î±` for Renyi entropy.
- The `KozachenkoLeonenko` estimator now correctly fixes its neighbor search to the
    *closest* neighbor only, and its constructor does no longer accept `k` as an input. It also uses correct scaling factor and adapts to dimension.
- Using a logarithm `base` different from `MathConstants.e` now yields correct results
    for `Kraskov` and `KozachenkoLeonenko`.

## main
* New probability estimator `SpatialSymbolicPermutation` suitable for computing spatial permutation entropies
* Introduce Tsallis entropy.

## 1.2
* Added dispersion entropy.

## 1.1
* Introduce convenience function `permentropy`.
* Several type instabilities fixed.

## 1.0
No actual changes, just first major version release.

## 0.12
* Nearest neighbor searches now use Neighborhood.jl and the Theiler window properly.

## 0.11.1
* `probabilities(data, n::Int)` now uses a rectangular binning of `n` bins for each dimension. Before, while not documented as possible in the public API, using integer `n` would take it as the bin size.
