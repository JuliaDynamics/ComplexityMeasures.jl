# New entropy: [information measure name here]

## Briefly describe the information measure type

What type of method is this? Is it a direct information measure (computes information measure from probabilities
that are estimated first), or an indirect estimator (computes information measure without estimating probabilities explicitly)?

- [ ] The new information measure (estimator) subtypes `InformationMeasure` (`DifferentialInfoEstimator`).
- [ ] The new information measure has an informative docstring, which is referenced in
    `docs/src/information_measures.md`.
- [ ] Relevant sources are cited in the docstring.
- [ ] Dispatch for `information`, and `information_maximum` (if relevant/possible), is implemented.
- [ ] A runnable example is included in the `docs/src/example.md` file.
- [ ] Tests are implemented.

Before finalizing the PR, it is useful to check that

- [ ] The tests run successfully locally.
