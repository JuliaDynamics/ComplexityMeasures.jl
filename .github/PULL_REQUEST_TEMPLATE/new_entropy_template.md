# New entropy: [entropy name here]

## Briefly describe the entropy type

What type of method is this? Is it a direct entropy (computes entropy from probabilities
that are estimated first), or an indirect estimator (computes entropy without estimating probabilities explicitly)?

- [ ] The new entropy (estimator) subtypes `EntropyDefinition` (`DiffEntropyEst`).
- [ ] The new entropy has an informative docstring, which is referenced in
    `docs/src/entropies.md`.
- [ ] Relevant sources are cited in the docstring.
- [ ] Dispatch for `entropy`, and `entropy_maximum` (if relevant/possible), is implemented.
- [ ] A runnable example is included in the `docs/src/example.md` file.
- [ ] Tests are implemented.

Before finalizing the PR, it is useful to check that

- [ ] The tests run successfully locally.
- [ ] The documentation build is successful locally, and looks good.
