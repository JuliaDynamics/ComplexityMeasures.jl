A Julia package that provides estimators for probabilities, entropies, and other
complexity emasures, in the context of nonlinear dynamics, nonlinear timeseries
analysis, and complex systems. It can be used as a standalone package, or as part
of several projects in the JuliaDynamics organization, such as
[DynamicalSystems.jl](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DynamicalSystems.jl/dev/)
or [CausalityTools.jl](https://juliadynamics.github.io/CausalityTools.jl/dev/).

To install it, run `import Pkg; Pkg.add("Entropies")`.

All further information is provided in the documentation, which you can either find [online](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Entropies.jl/dev/) or build locally by running the `docs/make.jl` file.
