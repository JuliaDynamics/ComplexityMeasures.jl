A Julia package that provides estimators for probabilities, information measures (entropies, extropies, etc.), and other complexity measures, in the context of nonlinear dynamics, nonlinear timeseries analysis, and complex systems.
It can be used as a standalone package, or as part of other projects in the JuliaDynamics organization, such as [DynamicalSystems.jl](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DynamicalSystems.jl/dev/) or [CausalityTools.jl](https://juliadynamics.github.io/CausalityTools.jl/dev/).

To install it, run `import Pkg; Pkg.add("ComplexityMeasures")`.

All further information is provided in the documentation, which you can either find [online](https://juliadynamics.github.io/ComplexityMeasures.jl/dev/) or build locally by running the `docs/make.jl` file.

_Previously, this package was called Entropies.jl._
