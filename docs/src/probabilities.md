# [Probabilities](@id estimators)

For categorical or integer-valued data, probabilities can be estimated by directly counting relative frequencies of data elements. For such data, use `probabilities(x::Array_or_Dataset) â†’ p::Probabilities`.

More advanced estimators computing probabilities by first either discretizing, symbolizing or transforming the data in a way that quantifies some useful properties about the underlying data (e.g. visitation frequencies, wavelet energies, or permutation patterns), from which probability distributions can be estimated. Use `probabilities(x::Array_or_Dataset, est::ProbabilitiesEstimator)` in combination with any of the estimators listed below.
