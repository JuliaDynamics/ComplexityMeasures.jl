# Complexity measures

In this page we document estimators for complexity measures that are not entropies in the strict mathematical sense. The API is almost identical to [`information`](@ref) and is defined by:

- [`complexity`](@ref)
- [`complexity_normalized`](@ref)
- [`ComplexityEstimator`](@ref)
