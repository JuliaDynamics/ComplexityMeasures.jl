# Complexity measures

!!! note
    Be sure you have gone through the [Tutorial](@ref) before going through the API here to have a good idea of the terminology used in ComplexityMeasures.jl.

## Complexity measures API

The complexity measure API is defined by the [`complexity`](@ref) function, which may take as an input an [`ComplexityEstimator`](@ref). The function [`complexity_normalized`](@ref) is also useful.
