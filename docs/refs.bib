Entropies S[p], associated with a given set of probabilities {pi}, that can be written in the simple form S[p]=∑i=1Wr(pi), are shown to be robust, if r(pi) is an analytic function of the pi's. The same property holds for entropies Σ(S[p]) that are monotonic and analytic functions of S[p]. The Tsallis entropy Sq[p] falls in the first class of entropies, whenever the entropic index q is an integer greater than 1. A new kind of entropy, that follows such requirements, is discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {Owing to the problems that imperfect decomposition process of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) denoising algorithm and poor self-adaptability, it will be extremely difficult to reduce the noise of signal. In this paper, a noise reduction method of underwater acoustic signal denoising based on complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), effort-to-compress complexity (ETC), refined composite multiscale dispersion entropy (RCMDE) and wavelet threshold denoising is proposed. Firstly, the original signal is decomposed into several IMFs by CEEMDAN and noise IMFs can be identified according to the ETC of IMFs. Then, calculating the RCMDE of remaining IMFs, these IMFs are divided into three kinds of IMFs by RCMDE, namely noise-dominant IMFs, real signal-dominant IMFs, real IMFs. Finally, noise IMFs are removed, wavelet soft threshold denoising is applied to noise-dominant IMFs and real signal-dominant IMFs. The denoised signal can be obtained by combining the real IMFs with the denoised IMFs after wavelet soft threshold denoising. Chaotic signals with different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are used for denoising experiments by comparing with EMD_MSE_WSTD and EEMD_DE_WSTD, it shows that the proposed algorithm has higher SNR and smaller root mean square error (RMSE). In order to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is applied to noise reduction of real underwater acoustic signals. The results show that the denoised underwater acoustic signals not only eliminate noise interference also restore the topological structure of the chaotic attractors more clearly, which lays a foundation for the further processing of underwater acoustic signals.},

  ABSTRACT = {Permutation entropy (PE), as one of the powerful complexity measures for analyzing time series, has advantages of easy implementation and high efficiency. In order to improve the performance of PE, some improved PE methods have been proposed through introducing amplitude information and distance information in recent years. Weighted-permutation entropy (W-PE) weight each arrangement pattern by using variance information, which has good robustness and stability in the case of high noise level and can extract complexity information from data with spike feature or abrupt amplitude change. Dispersion entropy (DE) introduces amplitude information by using the normal cumulative distribution function (NCDF); it not only can detect the change of simultaneous frequency and amplitude, but also is superior to the PE method in distinguishing different data sets. Reverse permutation entropy (RPE) is defined as the distance to white noise in the opposite trend with PE and W-PE, which has high stability for time series with varying lengths. To further improve the performance of PE, we propose a new complexity measure for analyzing time series, and term it as reverse dispersion entropy (RDE). RDE takes PE as its theoretical basis and combines the advantages of DE and RPE by introducing amplitude information and distance information. Simulation experiments were carried out on simulated and sensor signals, including mutation signal detection under different parameters, noise robustness testing, stability testing under different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and distinguishing real data for different kinds of ships and faults. The experimental results show, compared with PE, W-PE, RPE, and DE, that RDE has better performance in detecting abrupt signal and noise robustness testing, and has better stability for simulated and sensor signal. Moreover, it also shows higher distinguishing ability than the other four kinds of PE for sensor signals.},

  ABSTRACT = {We introduce a generalization of multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis. The method is termed MSEn, where the subscript denotes the moment used to coarse-grain a time series. MSEμ, described previously, uses the mean value (first moment). Here, we focus on MSEσ2 , which uses the second moment, i.e., the variance. MSEσ2 quantifies the dynamics of the volatility (variance) of a signal over multiple time scales. We use the method to analyze the structure of heartbeat time series. We find that the dynamics of the volatility of heartbeat time series obtained from healthy young subjects is highly complex. Furthermore, we find that the multiscale complexity of the volatility, not only the multiscale complexity of the mean heart rate, degrades with aging and pathology. The “bursty” behavior of the dynamics may be related to intermittency in energy and information flows, as part of multiscale cycles of activation and recovery. Generalized MSE may also be useful in quantifying the dynamical properties of other physiologic and of non-physiologic time series.},

The main advantages of this method include fast convergence of the estimator (as supported by numerical simulation) and the fact that there is no need to know the probability law of the process generating the signal. Furthermore, we present numerical and experimental comparisons of the new method against the standard method based on word frequencies, providing evidence that this new approach is an alternative entropy estimator for binned spike trains.}",

Consequently, accurate estimation of MI between two strongly dependent variables is possible only for prohibitively large sample size. This important yet overlooked shortcoming of the existing estimators is due to their implicit reliance on  local uniformity of the underlying joint distribution. We introduce a new  estimator that is robust to local non-uniformity, works well with limited data, and is able to capture relationship strengths over many orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed estimator on both synthetic and real-world data.}

We propose bias correction for the nearest neighbor estimator, which yields more accurate results in higher dimensions. In order to demonstrate the accuracy of the improvement, we calculated the corrected estimator for several families of random variables. For multivariate distributions, we considered the case of independent marginals and the dependence structure between the marginal distributions described by Gaussian copula. The presented solution may be particularly useful for high dimensional data, like those analyzed in the systems biology field. To illustrate such an application, we exploit differential entropy to define the robustness of biochemical kinetic models.},

When a random sample of individuals is selected and each individual is classified according to species identity, some rare species may not be discovered. This paper is concerned with the estimation of Shannon's index of diversity when the number of species and the species abundances are unknown. The traditional estimator that ignores the missing species underestimates when there is a non-negligible number of unseen species. We provide a different approach based on unequal probability sampling theory because species have different probabilities of being discovered in the sample. No parametric forms are assumed for the species abundances. The proposed estimation procedure combines the Horvitz--Thompson (1952) adjustment for missing species and the concept of sample coverage, which is used to properly estimate the relative abundances of species discovered in the sample. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator works well under various abundance models even when a relatively large fraction of the species is missing. Three real data sets, two from biology and the other one from numismatics, are given for illustration.},

  ABSTRACT = {We present a new class of estimators of Shannon entropy for severely undersampled discrete distributions. It is based on a generalization of an estimator proposed by T. Schürmann, which itself is a generalization of an estimator proposed by myself. For a special set of parameters, they are completely free of bias and have a finite variance, something which is widely believed to be impossible. We present also detailed numerical tests, where we compare them with other recent estimators and with exact results, and point out a clash with Bayesian estimators for mutual information.},

  abstract = {Ordinal patterns are the common basis of various techniques used in the study of dynamical systems and nonlinear time series analysis. The present article focusses on the computational problem of turning time series into sequences of ordinal patterns. In a first step, a numerical encoding scheme for ordinal patterns is proposed. Utilising the classical Lehmer code, it enumerates ordinal patterns by consecutive non-negative integers, starting from zero. This compact representation considerably simplifies working with ordinal patterns in the digital domain. Subsequently, three algorithms for the efficient extraction of ordinal patterns from time series are discussed, including previously published approaches that can be adapted to the Lehmer code. The respective strengths and weaknesses of those algorithms are discussed, and further substantiated by benchmark results. One of the algorithms stands out in terms of scalability: its run-time increases linearly with both the pattern order and the sequence length, while its memory footprint is practically negligible. These properties enable the study of high-dimensional pattern spaces at low computational cost. In summary, the tools described herein may improve the efficiency of virtually any ordinal pattern-based analysis method, among them quantitative measures like permutation entropy and symbolic transfer entropy, but also techniques like forbidden pattern identification. Moreover, the concepts presented may allow for putting ideas into practice that up to now had been hindered by computational burden. To enable smooth evaluation, a function library written in the C programming language, as well as language bindings and native implementations for various numerical computation environments are provided in the supplements.},

abstract = {Background and objective
Signal segmentation and spike detection are two important biomedical signal processing applications. Often, non-stationary signals must be segmented into piece-wise stationary epochs or spikes need to be found among a background of noise before being further analyzed. Permutation entropy (PE) has been proposed to evaluate the irregularity of a time series. PE is conceptually simple, structurally robust to artifacts, and computationally fast. It has been extensively used in many applications, but it has two key shortcomings. First, when a signal is symbolized using the Bandt–Pompe procedure, only the order of the amplitude values is considered and information regarding the amplitudes is discarded. Second, in the PE, the effect of equal amplitude values in each embedded vector is not addressed. To address these issues, we propose a new entropy measure based on PE: the amplitude-aware permutation entropy (AAPE).
Methods
AAPE is sensitive to the changes in the amplitude, in addition to the frequency, of the signals thanks to it being more flexible than the classical PE in the quantification of the signal motifs. To demonstrate how the AAPE method can enhance the quality of the signal segmentation and spike detection, a set of synthetic and realistic synthetic neuronal signals, electroencephalograms and neuronal data are processed. We compare the performance of AAPE in these problems against state-of-the-art approaches and evaluate the significance of the differences with a repeated ANOVA with post hoc Tukey's test.
Results
In signal segmentation, the accuracy of AAPE-based method is higher than conventional segmentation methods. AAPE also leads to more robust results in the presence of noise. The spike detection results show that AAPE can detect spikes well, even when presented with single-sample spikes, unlike PE. For multi-sample spikes, the changes in AAPE are larger than in PE.
Conclusion
We introduce a new entropy metric, AAPE, that enables us to consider amplitude information in the formulation of PE. The AAPE algorithm can be used in almost every irregularity-based application in various signal and image processing fields. We also made freely available the Matlab code of the AAPE.}

  abstract = {Since traditional electrical brain signal analysis is mostly qualitative, the development of new quantitative methods is crucial for restricting the subjectivity in the study of brain signals. These methods are particularly fruitful when they are strongly correlated with intuitive physical concepts that allow a better understanding of brain dynamics. Here, new method based on orthogonal discrete wavelet transform (ODWT) is applied. It takes as a basic element the ODWT of the EEG signal, and defines the relative wavelet energy, the wavelet entropy (WE) and the relative wavelet entropy (RWE). The relative wavelet energy provides information about the relative energy associated with different frequency bands present in the EEG and their corresponding degree of importance. The WE carries information about the degree of order/disorder associated with a multi-frequency signal response, and the RWE measures the degree of similarity between different segments of the signal. In addition, the time evolution of the WE is calculated to give information about the dynamics in the EEG records. Within this framework, the major objective of the present work was to characterize in a quantitative way functional dynamics of order/disorder microstates in short duration EEG signals. For that aim, spontaneous EEG signals under different physiological conditions were analyzed. Further, specific quantifiers were derived to characterize how stimulus affects electrical events in terms of frequency synchronization (tuning) in the event related potentials.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional sample entropy (SampEn2D) is a recently developed method in the field of information theory for evaluating the regularity or predictability of images. SampEn2D, though powerful, has two key limitations: (1) SampEn2D values are undefined for small-sized images; and (2) SampEn2D is computationally expensive for several real-world applications. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce the two-dimensional dispersion entropy (DispEn2D) measure. To evaluate the ability of DispEn2D, in comparison with SampEn2D, we use various synthetic and real datasets. The results demonstrate that DispEn2D distinguishes different amounts of white Gaussian and salt and pepper noise. The periodic images, compared with their corresponding synthesized ones, have lower DispEn2D values. The results for Kylberg texture dataset show the ability of DispEn2D to differentiate various textures. Although the results based on DispEn2D and SampEn2D for both the synthetic and real datasets are consistent in that they lead to similar findings about the irregularity of images, DispEn2D has three main advantages over SampEn2D: (1) DispEn2D, unlike SampEn2D, does not lead to undefined values; (2) DispEn2D is noticeably quicker; and (3) The coefficient of variations and Mann–Whitney U test-based p-values for DispEn2D are considerably smaller, showing the more stability of the DispEn2D results. Overall, thanks to its successful performance and low computational time, DispEn2D opens up a new way to analyze the uncertainty of images.}

We build up a numerical procedure that can be easily implemented to evaluate the complexity of two or higher-dimensional patterns. We work out this method in different scenarios where numerical experiments and empirical data were taken into account. Specifically, we have applied the method to  fractal landscapes generated numerically where we compare our measures with the Hurst exponent;  liquid crystal textures where nematic-isotropic-nematic phase transitions were properly identified;  12 characteristic textures of liquid crystals where the different values show that the method can distinguish different phases;  and Ising surfaces where our method identified the critical temperature and also proved to be stable.},
