    OutcomeSpace

The supertype for all outcome space implementation.

## Description

In ComplexityMeasures.jl, an outcome space defines a set of possible outcomes
``\\Omega = \\{\\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\ldots, \\omega_L \\}`` (some form of
discretization). In the literature, the outcome space is often called an "alphabet",
while each outcome is called a "symbol" or an "event".

An outcome space also defines a set of rules for mapping input data to
to each outcome ``\\omega_i`` (i.e. [encoding](@ref encodings)/discretizing).

In the column "input data" it is assumed that the `eltype` of the input is `<: Real`.

## Usage

Outcome spaces are used as input to

- [`probabilities`](@ref)/[`allprobabilities`](@ref) for computing probability
    mass functions.
- [`outcome_space`](@ref), which returns the elements of the outcome space.
- [`total_outcomes`](@ref), which returns the cardinality of the outcome space.
- [`counts`](@ref)/[`allcounts`](@ref), for obtaining raw counts instead
    of probabilities (only for counting-compatible outcome spaces).

## Counting-compatible vs. non-counting compatible outcome spaces

There are two main types of outcome spaces.

- Counting-compatible outcome spaces have a well-defined
    way of counting how often each point in the (encoded) input data is mapped to a
    particular outcome ``\\omega_i``. These outcome spaces use
    [`encode`](@ref) to discretize the input data. Examples are
    [`SymbolicPermutation`](@ref) (which encodes input data into ordinal patterns) or
    [`ValueHistogram`](@ref) (which discretizes points onto a regular grid).
    The table below lists which outcome spaces are counting compatible.
- Non-counting compatible outcome spaces have no well-defined way of counting explicitly
    how often each point in the input data is mapped to a particular outcome ``\\omega_i``.
    Instead, these outcome spaces returns a vector of pre-normalized "relative counts", one
    for each outcome ``\\omega_i``. Examples are [`WaveletOverlap`](@ref) or
    [`PowerSpectrum`](@ref).

Counting-compatible outcome spaces can be used with *any* [`ProbabilitiesEstimator`](@ref)
to convert counts into probability mass functions.
Non-counting-compatible outcome spaces can only be used with the maximum likelihood
([`RelativeAmount`](@ref)) probabilities estimator, which estimates probabilities precisely by the
relative frequency of each outcome (formally speaking, the [`RelativeAmount`](@ref) estimator also
requires counts, but for the sake of code consistency, we allow it to be used with
relative frequencies as well).

The function [`is_counting_based`](@ref) can be used to check whether an outcome space
is based on counting.

## Deducing the outcome space (from data)

Some outcome space models can deduce ``\\Omega`` without knowledge of the input, such as
[`SymbolicPermutation`](@ref). Other outcome spaces require knowledge of the input data
for concretely specifying ``\\Omega``, such as [`ValueHistogram`](@ref) with
[`RectangularBinning`](@ref). If `o` is some outcome space model and `x` some input data, then
[`outcome_space`](@ref)`(o, x)` returns the possible outcomes ``\\Omega``. To get the
cardinality of ``\\Omega``, use [`total_outcomes`](@ref).

## Implementation details

The element type of ``\\Omega`` varies between outcome space models, but it is guaranteed
to be _hashable_ and _sortable_. This allows for conveniently tracking the counts of a
specific event across experimental realizations, by using the outcome as a dictionary key
and the counts as the value for that key (or, alternatively, the key remains the outcome
and one has a vector of probabilities, one for each experimental realization).
