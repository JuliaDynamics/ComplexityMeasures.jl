`Probabilities` is a simple wrapper around `x::AbstractArray{<:Real, N}` that ensures its
values sum to 1, so that `p` can be interpreted as `N`-dimensional probability mass
function. In most use cases, `p` will be a vector. `p` behaves exactly like
its contained data `x` with respect to indexing and iteration.

    ProbabilitiesEstimator

The supertype for all probabilities estimators.

The role of the probabilities estimator is to convert (pseudo-)counts to probabilities.
Currently, the implementation of all probabilities estimators assume *finite* outcome
space with known cardinality (i.e. the user must *model*/*assume* what this outcome space
is). Therefore, `ProbabilitiesEstimator` accept an [`OutcomeSpace`](@ref) as the first
argument, which specifies the set of possible outcomes.

## Implementations

The default probabilities estimator is [`RelativeAmount`](@ref), which is compatible with any
[`OutcomeSpace`](@ref). The following estimators only support counting-based outcomes.

- [`Shrinkage`](@ref).
- [`Bayes`](@ref).
- [`AddConstant`](@ref).

## Description

In ComplexityMeasures.jl, probability mass functions
are estimated from data by defining a set of
possible outcomes ``\\Omega = \\{\\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\ldots, \\omega_L \\}`` (by
specifying an [`OutcomeSpace`](@ref)), and
assigning to each outcome ``\\omega_i`` a probability ``p(\\omega_i)``, such that
``\\sum_{i=1}^N p(\\omega_i) = 1`` (by specifying a `ProbabilitiesEstimator`).

## Used with

- [`probabilities`](@ref)/[`probabilities_and_outcomes`](@ref) for estimating a probability
    distribution over some [`OutcomeSpace`](@ref) from input data.
- [`allprobabilities`](@ref)/[`allprobabilities_and_outcomes`](@ref) for estimating a
    probability distribution from input data, guaranteeing inclusion of zero-probability
    outcomes.

The returned probabilities `p` are a [`Probabilities`](@ref) (`Vector`-like), where each
element `p[i]` is the probability of the outcome `ω[i]`. Using an [`OutcomeSpace`](@ref)
directly as input to [`probabilities`](@ref) or related functions is also possible, and is
equivalent to using the [`RelativeAmount`](@ref) estimator.

    probabilities(o::OutcomeSpace, x::Array_or_SSSet) → p::Probabilities
    probabilities(est::ProbabilitiesEstimator, x::Array_or_SSSet) → p::Probabilities

Compute a probability distribution over the set of possible outcomes
defined by the [`OutcomeSpace`](@ref) `o`, given input data `x`, using maximum likelihood
probability estimation ([`RelativeAmount`](@ref)).

To use some other form of probabilities estimation than [`RelativeAmount`](@ref), use the second
signature. In this case, the outcome space is given as the first argument to a
[`ProbabilitiesEstimator`](@ref). Note that this only works for counting-based outcome
spaces (see [`OutcomeSpace`](@ref)'s docstring for list of compatible outcome spaces).

The input data is typically an `Array` or a `StateSpaceSet` (or `SSSet` for sort); see
[Input data for ComplexityMeasures.jl](@ref). Configuration options are always given as
arguments to the chosen outcome space.

To obtain the outcomes corresponding to the probabilities `p`, use [`outcomes`](@ref),
or [`probabilities_and_outcomes`](@ref), which return both the probabilities and the
outcomes together.

Due to performance optimizations, whether the returned probabilities
contain `0`s as entries or not depends on the outcome space.
E.g., in [`ValueHistogram`](@ref) `0`s are skipped, while in
[`PowerSpectrum`](@ref) `0` are not, because we get them for free.
Use [`allprobabilities`](@ref)/[`allprobabilities_and_outcomes`](@ref) to guarantee that
zero probabilities are also returned (may be slower).

## Examples

```julia
x = randn(500)
ps = probabilities(OrdinalPatterns(m = 3), x)
ps = probabilities(ValueHistogram(RectangularBinning(5)), x)
ps = probabilities(WaveletOverlap(), x)
```

The outcome space is here given as the first argument to `est`.

## Examples

```julia
x = randn(500)

# Syntactically equivalent to `probabilities(OrdinalPatterns(m = 3), x)`
ps = probabilities(RelativeAmount(OrdinalPatterns(m = 3)), x)

# Some more sophisticated ways of estimating probabilities:
ps = probabilities(Bayes(OrdinalPatterns(m = 3)), x)
ps = probabilities(Shrinkage(ValueHistogram(RectangularBinning(5))), x)

# Only the `RelativeAmount` estimator works with non-counting based outcome spaces,
# like for example `WaveletOverlap`.
ps = probabilities(RelativeAmount(WaveletOverlap()), x) # works
ps = probabilities(Bayes(WaveletOverlap()), x) # errors
```

    probabilities(x::Vector_or_SSSet) → p::Probabilities

Estimate probabilities by using directly counting the elements of `x`, assuming that
`Ω = sort(unique(x))`, i.e. that the outcome space is the unique elements of `x`.
This is mostly useful when `x` contains categorical data. It is syntactically equivalent
to `probabilities(RelativeAmount(CountOccurrences()), x)`.

Return `probs, outs`, where `probs = probabilities(est, x)` and

`outs` is a subset of the [`outcome_space`](@ref) of `est`.

The same as [`probabilities`](@ref), but ensures that outcomes with `0` probability

of `ospace[i]`, with `ospace = `[`outcome_space`](@ref)`(est, x)`.

This function is useful in cases where one wants to compare the probability mass functions
of two different input data `x, y` under the same estimator. E.g., to compute the
KL-divergence of the two PMFs assumes that the obey the same indexing. This is
not true for [`probabilities`](@ref) even with the same `est`, due to the skipping
of 0 entries, but it is true for [`allprobabilities`](@ref).
