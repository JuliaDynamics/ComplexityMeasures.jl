"""
    VisitationFrequency(r::RectangularBinning) <: BinningProbabilitiesEstimator

A probability estimator based on binning data into rectangular boxes dictated by
the binning scheme `r`.


## Example

```julia
# Construct boxes by dividing each coordinate axis into 5 equal-length chunks.
b = RectangularBinning(5)

# A probabilities estimator that, when applied a dataset, computes visitation frequencies
# over the boxes of the binning, constructed as describedon the previous line.
est = VisitationFrequency(b)
```
