    encode_as_bin(point, reference_point, edgelengths) → Vector{Int}

Encode a point into its integer bin labels relative to some `reference_point`
(always counting from lowest to highest magnitudes), given a set of box 
`edgelengths` (one for each axis). The first bin on the positive side of 
the reference point is indexed with 0, and the first bin on the negative 
side of the reference point is indexed with -1.

## Example 

```julia
using Entropies

refpoint = [0, 0, 0]
steps = [0.2, 0.2, 0.3]
encode_as_bin(rand(3), refpoint, steps)
```

    joint_visits(points, binning_scheme::RectangularBinning) → Vector{Vector{Int}}

Determine which bins are visited by `points` given the rectangular binning
scheme `ϵ`. Bins are referenced relative to the axis minima, and are 
encoded as integers, such that each box in the binning is assigned a
unique integer array (one element for each dimension). 

For example, if a bin is visited three times, then the corresponding 
integer array will appear three times in the array returned.

    marginal_visits(points, binning_scheme::RectangularBinning, dims) → Vector{Vector{Int}}

Determine which bins are visited by `points` given the rectangular binning

relative to the axis minima, and are encoded as integers, such that each box 
in the binning is assigned a unique integer array (one element for each 
dimension in `dims`). 

For example, if a bin is visited three times, then the corresponding
