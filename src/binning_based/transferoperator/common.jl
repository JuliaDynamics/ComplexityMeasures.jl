    TransferOperator(ϵ::Union{RectangularBinning, SimplexPoint, SimplexExact}) <: BinningProbabilitiesEstimator

A probability estimator based on binning data into rectangular boxes 
(when `ϵ` is a [`RectangularBinning`](@ref)) or simplices (when `ϵ` is a 
[`SimplexExact`](@ref) or `ϵ` is a [`SimplexPoint`](@ref)). 

To use triangulation-based estimators, run `using Simplices` after `using Entropies`.

The transfer (Perron-Frobenius) operator is approximated over the bins, using different 
methods depending on the type of partition chosen. The invariant measure associated with 
the approximated transfer operator is taken the bin probabilities. 

# Description (rectangular binning)

This implementation follows the grid estimator approach in Diego et al. (2019)[^Diego2019].

The transfer operator ``P^{N}``is computed as an `N`-by-`N` matrix of transition 
probabilities between the states defined by the partition elements, where `N` is the 
number of boxes in the partition that is visited by the orbit/points. 

If  ``\\{x_t^{(D)} \\}_{n=1}^L`` are the ``L`` different ``D``-dimensional points over 
which the transfer operator is approximated, ``\\{ C_{k=1}^N \\}`` are the ``N`` different 
partition elements (as dictated by `ϵ`) that gets visited by the points, and
 ``\\phi(x_t) = x_{t+1}``, then

```math
P_{ij} = \\dfrac
{\\#\\{ x_n | \\phi(x_n) \\in C_j \\cap x_n \\in C_i \\}}
{\\#\\{ x_m | x_m \\in C_i \\}},
```

where ``\\#`` denotes the cardinal. The element ``P_{ij}`` thus indicates how many points 
that are initially in box ``C_i`` end up in box ``C_j`` when the points in ``C_i`` are 
projected one step forward in time. Thus, the row ``P_{ik}^N`` where 
``k \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, N \\}`` gives the probability 
of jumping from the state defined by box ``C_i`` to any of the other ``N`` states. It 
follows that ``\\sum_{k=1}^{N} P_{ik} = 1`` for all ``i``. Thus, ``P^N`` is a row/right 
stochastic matrix.

For a detailed description of the triangulation estimators, see 
Diego et al. (2019)[^Diego2019].

### Invariant measure estimation from transfer operator

The left invariant distribution ``\\mathbf{\\rho}^N`` is a row vector, where 
``\\mathbf{\\rho}^N P^{N} = \\mathbf{\\rho}^N``. Hence, ``\\mathbf{\\rho}^N`` is a row 
eigenvector of the transfer matrix ``P^{N}`` associated with eigenvalue 1. The distribution 
``\\mathbf{\\rho}^N`` approximates the invariant density of the system subject to the 
partition `ϵ`, and can be taken as a probability distribution over the partition elements.

In practice, the invariant measure ``\\mathbf{\\rho}^N`` is computed using 
[`invariantmeasure`](@ref), which also approximates the transfer matrix. The invariant distribution
is initialized as a length-`N` random distribution which is then applied to ``P^{N}``. 
The resulting length-`N` distribution is then applied to ``P^{N}`` again. This process 
repeats until the difference between the distributions over consecutive iterations is 
below some threshold. 

## Probability and entropy estimation

- `probabilities(x::AbstractDataset, est::TransferOperator)` estimates 
    probabilities for the bins defined by the provided binning (`est.ϵ`)
- `genentropy(x::AbstractDataset, est::TransferOperator)` does the same, 
    but computes generalized entropy using the probabilities.

## Examples

Here, we create three different transfer operator-based estimators.

A rectangular binning is suited for datasets with a large number of points.

```@example
using Entropies
pts = Dataset(rand(2000, 3))
est_rect = TransferOperator(RectangularBinning(5))
genentropy(pts, est_rect)
```

A triangulated binning, using approximate simplex intersections, is also possible for 
datasets with not too many points (say, <1000 points). If so, we must first import 
the Simplices.jl package.

```@example
using Entropies, Simplices
pts = Dataset(rand(200, 3))
est_point = TransferOperator(SimplexPoint())
genentropy(pts, est_point)
```

For datasets with few points, say <100 points, exact simplex intersections may also 
be computationally feasible.

```@example
using Entropies, Simplices
est_exact = TransferOperator(SimplexExact())
pts = Dataset(rand(40, 3))
genentropy(pts, est_exact)
```

    TransferOperatorApproximation(generator, transfermatrix, params)

A return struct containing the `generator` of the transfer operator approximation (an 
instance of `TransferOperator{R} where R`; if `R` is a `RectangularBinning`, then a 
rectangular binning was used, whereas if `R` is `SimplexPoint` or `SimplexExact`, then 
a triangulated binning as used). 

The `transfermatrix` is an `N`-by-`N` matrix approximation to the transfer operator, 
subject to the partition given by `generator` (details about the partition are available
in the `generator.init` field), computed over some set of sequentially ordered points. 

# Parameters

The parameters of the approximation is given to `params`. 

When `R <: RectangularBinning`, parameters stored are as follows.

- The `mini` and `edgelengths` parameters provide the minima and box edge lengths along each 
    coordinate axis, as determined by applying `ϵ` to the points. 
- The coordinates of the (leftmost, if axis is ordered low-high) box corners are given in 
    `bins`. Only bins actually visited by the points are considered, and `bins` give the 
    coordinates of these bins. The element `bins[i]` correspond to the `i`-th state of the 
    system, which corresponds to the `i`-th column/row of `transfermatrix`.
- `sort_idxs` contains the indices that would sort the input points. 
- `visitors` is a vector of vectors, where `visitors[i]` contains the indices of the 
    (sorted) points that visits `bins[i]`.

When `R <: SimplexPoint`, parameters stored are the simplex subsampling parameters.
When `R <: SimplexExact`, parameters stored are the simplex intersection tolerances.

    TransitionInfo(transfermatrix, bins)

Structure that holds the `transfermatrix` of transition probabilities obtained from a 
transfer operator approximation, as well as the `bins` of the partition.

- If `transfermatrix` was obtained using a rectangular binning, then `bins` is a 
    two-element named tuple with fields `bins` (the left-most coordinates of the bins) and 
    `edgelengths` (the edge lengths along each coordinate axis).
- If `transfermatrix` was obtained using a triangulated binning, then `bins` is a 
    two-element named tuple with fields `pts` (the points of the triangulation), and 
    `triang`, the indices of the vertices of all simplices. Here, `pts[triang[i]]` is a 
    vector of vertices for the `i`-th simplex of the triangulation.

`bins[i]` corresponds to the i-th row/column of `transfermatrix.` Thus, the entry 
`transfermatrix[i, j]` is the probability of jumping from the state defined by `bins[i]` 
to the state defined by `bins[j]`.

Estimate an invariant measure over the points in `x` based on binning the data into 
rectangular boxes dictated by the binning scheme `ϵ`, then approximate the transfer 
(Perron-Frobenius) operator over the bins. From the approximation to the transfer operator, 
compute an invariant distribution over the bins. Assumes that the input data are sequential.

Details on the estimation procedure is found the [`TransferOperator`](@ref) docstring.

## Example 

```julia
using DynamicalSystems, Plots, Entropies
D = 4
ds = Systems.lorenz96(D; F = 32.0)
N, dt = 20000, 0.1
orbit = trajectory(ds, N*dt; dt = dt, Ttr = 10.0)

# Estimate the invariant measure over some rectangular coarse graining of the orbit.
iv = invariantmeasure(orbit, RectangularBinning(15))

# Get the probabilities and bins 
invariantmeasure(iv)
```

## Probabilities and bin information

    invariantmeasure(iv::InvariantMeasure) → (ρ::Probabilities, bins::Vector{<:SVector})

From a pre-computed invariant measure, return the probabilities and associated bins. 
The element `ρ[i]` is the probability of visitation to the box `bins[i]`. Analogous to 
[`binhist`](@ref). 


!!! hint "Transfer operator approach vs. naive histogram approach"

    Why bother with the transfer operator instead of using regular histograms to obtain 
    probabilities? 
    
    In fact, the naive histogram approach and the 
    transfer operator approach are equivalent in the limit of long enough time series 
    (as ``n \\to \\intfy``), which is guaranteed by the ergodic theorem. There is a crucial
    difference, however:
    
    The naive histogram approach only gives the long-term probabilities that 
    orbits visit a certain region of the state space. The transfer operator encodes that 
    information too, but comes with the added benefit of knowing the *transition 
    probabilities* between states (see [`transitioninfo`](@ref)).
