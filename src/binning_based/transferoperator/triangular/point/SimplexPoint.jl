    SimplexPoint <: TriangularBinning

A transfer operator estimator using a triangulated partition, and using 
approximate simplex intersections to compute transition probabilities [^Diego2019]. 

!!! hint
    To use this estimator, the Simplices.jl package must be brought into scope by doing 
    `using Simplices` after running `using Entropies`.
