Instructions for creating a rectangular box partition using the binning scheme `ϵ`. 
Binning instructions are deduced from the type of `ϵ`.


Rectangular binnings may be automatically adjusted to the data in which the `RectangularBinning` 
is applied, as follows:

1. `ϵ::Int` divides each coordinate axis into `ϵ` equal-length intervals, 
    extending the upper bound 1/100th of a bin size to ensure all points are covered.

2. `ϵ::Float64` divides each coordinate axis into intervals of fixed size `ϵ`, starting 
    from the axis minima until the data is completely covered by boxes.

3. `ϵ::Vector{Int}` divides the i-th coordinate axis into `ϵ[i]` equal-length 
    intervals, extending the upper bound 1/100th of a bin size to ensure all points are 
    covered.

4. `ϵ::Vector{Float64}` divides the i-th coordinate axis into intervals of fixed size `ϵ[i]`, starting 
    from the axis minima until the data is completely covered by boxes.

Rectangular binnings may also be specified on arbitrary min-max ranges. 

5. `ϵ::Tuple{Vector{Tuple{Float64,Float64}},Int64}` creates intervals 
    along each coordinate axis from ranges indicated by a vector of `(min, max)` tuples, then divides 
    each coordinate axis into an integer number of equal-length intervals. *Note: this does not ensure 
    that all points are covered by the data (points outside the binning are ignored)*.


# Example 1: Grid deduced automatically from data (partition guaranteed to cover data points)

## Flexible box sizes 

The following binning specification finds the minima/maxima along each coordinate axis, then 
split each of those data ranges (with some tiny padding on the edges) into `10` equal-length 
intervals. This gives (hyper-)rectangular boxes, and works for data of any dimension.

```julia
using Entropies
RectangularBinning(10)
```

Now, assume the data consists of 2-dimensional points, and that we want a finer grid along
one of the dimensions than over the other dimension.

The following binning specification finds the minima/maxima along each coordinate axis, then 
splits the range along the first coordinate axis (with some tiny padding on the edges) 
into `10` equal-length intervals, and the range along the second coordinate axis (with some 
tiny padding on the edges) into `5` equal-length intervals.
This gives (hyper-)rectangular boxes.

```julia
using Entropies
RectangularBinning([10, 5])
```

## Fixed box sizes 

The following binning specification finds the minima/maxima along each coordinate axis, 
then split the axis ranges into equal-length intervals of fixed size `0.5` until the all data 
points are covered by boxes. This approach yields (hyper-)cubic boxes, and works for 
data of any dimension.

```julia
using Entropies
RectangularBinning(0.5)
```

Again, assume the data consists of 2-dimensional points, and that we want a finer grid along
one of the dimensions than over the other dimension.

The following binning specification finds the minima/maxima along each coordinate axis, then splits
the range along the first coordinate axis into equal-length intervals of size `0.3`,
and the range along the second axis into equal-length intervals of size `0.1` (in both cases, 
making sure the data are completely covered by the boxes).
This approach gives a (hyper-)rectangular boxes. 

```julia
using Entropies
RectangularBinning([0.3, 0.1])
```

# Example 2: Custom grids (partition not guaranteed to cover data points): 

Assume the data consists of 3-dimensional points `(x, y, z)`, and that we want a grid 
that is fixed over the intervals `[x₁, x₂]` for the first dimension, over `[y₁, y₂]`
for the second dimension, and over `[z₁, z₂]` for the third dimension. We when want to
split each of those ranges into 4 equal-length pieces. *Beware: some points may fall 
outside the partition if the intervals are not chosen properly (these points are 
simply discarded)*. 

The following binning specification produces the desired (hyper-)rectangular boxes. 

```julia
using Entropies, DelayEmbeddings

D = Dataset(rand(100, 3));

x₁, x₂ = 0.5, 1 # not completely covering the data, which are on [0, 1]
y₁, y₂ = -2, 1.5 # covering the data, which are on [0, 1]
z₁, z₂ = 0, 0.5 # not completely covering the data, which are on [0, 1]

ϵ = [(x₁, x₂), (y₁, y₂), (z₁, z₂)], 4 # [interval 1, interval 2, ...], n_subdivisions
