    OrdinalPatternEncoding(; m::Int, lt = est.lt)

An encoding scheme that [`encode`](@ref)s `m`-dimensional permutation/ordinal patterns to
integers and [`decode`](@ref)s these integers to permutation patterns based on the Lehmer
code.

## Usage

Used in [`outcomes`](@ref) with probabilities estimators such as
[`SymbolicPermutation`](@ref) to map state vectors `xᵢ ∈ x` into their
integer symbol representations `πᵢ`.

## Description

The Lehmer code, as implemented here, is a bijection between the set of `factorial(n)`
possible permutations for a length-`n` sequence, and the integers `1, 2, …, n`.

- *Encoding* converts an `m`-dimensional permutation pattern `p` into its unique integer
    symbol ``\\omega \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, m - 1 \\}``, using Algorithm 1 in Berger
    et al. (2019)[^Berger2019].
- *Decoding* converts an ``\\omega_i \\in \\Omega` ` to its original permutation pattern.

`OrdinalPatternEncoding` is thus meant to be applied on a *permutation*, i.e.
a vector of indices that would sort some vector in ascending order (in practice: the
result of calling `sortperm(x)` for some input vector `x`).

## Example

```jldoctest
julia> using Entropies

julia> x = [1.2, 5.4, 2.2, 1.1]; encoding = OrdinalPatternEncoding(m = length(x));

julia> xs = sortperm(x)
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 4
 1
 3
 2

julia> s = encode(encoding, xs)
20

julia> decode(encoding, s)
4-element SVector{4, Int64} with indices SOneTo(4):
 4
 1
 3
 2
```

        ndigits::Int = ndigits_in_factorial_base(s)) → f::SVector{ndigits, Int}

Convert a base-10 integer to its factorial number system representation. `f` is a
vector where `f[k]` is the multiplier of `factorial(k - 1)`.

For example, the base-10 integer `567`, in the factorial number system, is
``4\\cdot 5! + 3\\cdot 4! + 2\\cdot 3! + 1\\cdot 2! + 1\\cdot 1! + 0\\cdot 0!``.
For this example, `base10_to_factorial` would return the `SVector` `[4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0]`.

`ndigits` fixes the number of digits in `f` (this just prepends a zero to `f` for each
extraneous radix/base). This is useful when using factorial number for decoding Lehmer codes
into permutations
