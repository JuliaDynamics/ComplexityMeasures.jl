    Kraskov <: IndirectEntropy
    Kraskov(; k::Int = 1, w::Int = 1, base = 2)

An indirect entropy used in [`entropy`](@ref)`(Kraskov(), x)` to estimate the Shannon
entropy of `x` (a multi-dimensional `Dataset`) to the given
`base` using `k`-th nearest neighbor searches as in [^Kraskov2004].

`w` is the Theiler window, which determines if temporal neighbors are excluded
during neighbor searches (defaults to `0`, meaning that only the point itself is excluded
when searching for neighbours).

See also: [`KozachenkoLeonenko`](@ref).
