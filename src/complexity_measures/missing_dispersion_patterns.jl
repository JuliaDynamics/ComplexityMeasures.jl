    missing_dispersion(x::AbstractVector{T}; est::Dispersion = Dispersion()) â†’ N::Real

Calculate the number of missing dispersion patterns (NMDP; Zhou et al., 2022) resulting
from symbolising `x` and embedding the resulting symbol sequence (using the parameters of
`est`) into "dispersion patterns" (each embedding vector is a dispersion pattern).

The state vectors of the resulting embedding are called "dispersion patterns", and there
are `L = alphabet_length(est)` possible patterns. The number of missing dispersion patterns
is simply `L - N`, where `N` is the number of patterns actually occurring.

Used to detect nonlinearity in a time series by comparing the NMDP `x` to NMDP values for
an ensemble of IAAFT surrogates of `x`.
