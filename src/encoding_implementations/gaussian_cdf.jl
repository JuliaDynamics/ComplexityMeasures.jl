    GaussianCDFEncoding <: Encoding
    GaussianCDFEncoding{m}(; μ, σ, c::Int = 3)

An encoding scheme that [`encode`](@ref)s a scalar or vector `χ` into one of the integers
`sᵢ ∈ [1, 2, …, c]` based on the normal cumulative distribution function (NCDF),
and [`decode`](@ref)s the `sᵢ` into subintervals of `[0, 1]` (with some loss of information).

## Initializing a `GaussianCDFEncoding`

The size of the input to be encoded must be known beforehand. One must therefore set
`m = length(χ)`, where `χ` is the input (`m = 1` for scalars, `m ≥ 2` for vectors).
To do so, one must explicitly give `m` as a type parameter: e.g.
`encoding = GaussianCDFEncoding{3}(; μ = 0.0, σ = 0.1)` to encode 3-element vectors,
or `encoding = GaussianCDFEncoding{1}(; μ = 0.0, σ = 0.1)` to encode scalars.

## Description

### Encoding/decoding scalars

`GaussianCDFEncoding` first maps an input scalar ``χ`` to a new real number
``y_ \\in [0, 1]`` by using the normal cumulative distribution function (CDF) with the
given mean `μ` and standard deviation `σ`, according to the map

```math
x \\to y : y = \\dfrac{1}{ \\sigma
    \\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} e^{(-(x - \\mu)^2)/(2 \\sigma^2)} dx.
```

Next, the interval `[0, 1]` is equidistantly binned and enumerated ``1, 2, \\ldots, c``,
 and ``y`` is linearly mapped to one of these integers using the linear map
 ``y \\to z : z = \\text{floor}(y(c-1)) + 1``.

Because of the floor operation, some information is lost, so when used with
[`decode`](@ref), each decoded `sᵢ` is mapped to a *subinterval* of `[0, 1]`.
This subinterval is returned as a length-`1` `Vector{SVector}`.

Notice that the decoding step does not yield an element of any outcome space of the
estimators that use `GaussianCDFEncoding` internally, such as [`Dispersion`](@ref).
That is because these estimators additionally delay embed the encoded data.

### Encoding/decoding vectors

If `GaussianCDFEncoding` is used with a vector `χ`, then each element of `χ` is
encoded separately, resulting in a `length(χ)` sequence of integers which may be
treated as a `CartesianIndex`. The encoded symbol `s ∈ [1, 2, …, c]` is then just the
linear index corresponding to this cartesian index (similar to how
[CombinationEncoding](@ref) works).

When [`decode`](@ref)d, the integer symbol `s` is converted back into its `CartesianIndex`
representation,  which is just a sequence of integers that refer to subdivisions
of the `[0, 1]` interval. The relevant subintervals are then returned as a length-`χ`
`Vector{SVector}`.
