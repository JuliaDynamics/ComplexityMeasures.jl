    CountOccurrences()

An [`OutcomeSpace`](@ref) based on straight-forward counting of distinct elements in
a univariate time series or multivariate dataset. This is the same as giving no
estimator to [`probabilities`](@ref).

## Outcome space

The outcome space is the unique sorted values of the input.
Hence, input `x` is needed for a well-defined [`outcome_space`](@ref).
