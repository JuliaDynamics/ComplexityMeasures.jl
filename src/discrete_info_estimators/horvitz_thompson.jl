The `HorvitzThompson` estimator is used with [`information`](@ref) to compute the
discrete [`Shannon`](@ref) entropy according to [Horvitz1952](@citet).

# Description

The Horvitz-Thompson estimator of [`Shannon`](@ref) entropy is given by

```math
H_S^{HT} = -\\sum_{i=1}^M \\dfrac{p_i \\log(p_i) }{1 - (1 - p_i)^N},
```

where ``N`` is the sample size and ``M`` is the number of [`outcomes`](@ref).
Given the true probability ``p_i`` of the ``i``-th outcome, ``1 - (1 - p_i)^N`` is the
probability that the outcome appears at least once in a sample of size ``N``
[Arora2022](@cite). Dividing by this inclusion probability is a form of weighting, and
compensates for situations where certain outcomes have so low probabilities that they are
not often observed in a sample, for example in power-law distributions.
