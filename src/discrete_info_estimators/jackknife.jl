    Jackknife(definition::InformationMeasure = Shannon())

The `Jackknife` estimator is used with [`information`](@ref) to compute any
discrete [`InformationMeasure`](@ref).

The `Jackknife` estimator uses the generic jackknife principle to reduce bias.
[Zahl1977](@citet) was the first to apply the jaccknife technique in the context of
[`Shannon`](@ref) entropy estimation. Here, we've generalized his estimator to work
with any [`InformationMeasure`](@ref).

## Description

As an example of the jackknife technique, here is the formula for a jackknife estimate
of [`Shannon`](@ref) entropy

```math
H_S^{J} = N H_S^{plugin} - \\dfrac{N-1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N {H_S^{plugin}}^{-\\{i\\}},
```

where ``N`` is the sample size, ``H_S^{plugin}`` is the plugin estimate of Shannon entropy,
and ``{H_S^{plugin}}^{-\\{i\\}}`` is the plugin estimate, but computed with the ``i``-th
sample left out.
