    Dispersion(; encoding =  GaussianCDFEncoding(c = 5), m = 2, τ = 1,
        check_unique = true)

A probability estimator based on dispersion patterns, originally used by
Rostaghi & Azami, 2016[^Rostaghi2016] to compute the "dispersion entropy", which
characterizes the complexity and irregularity of a time series.

Relative frequencies of dispersion patterns are computed using the given `encoding` scheme
with embedding dimension `m` and embedding delay `τ`. Recommended parameter
values[^Li2018] are `m ∈ [2, 3]`, `τ = 1` for the embedding, and `c ∈ [3, 4, …, 8]`
categories for the Gaussian symbol mapping.

## Description

Assume we have a univariate time series ``X = \\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^N``. First, this time series
is discretized using `symbolization`, which default to [`GaussianCDFEncoding`](@ref),
which uses the normal cumulative distribution function (CDF) for encoding.
Other choices of CDFs are also possible, but Entropies.jl currently only implements
[`GaussianCDFEncoding`](@ref), which was used in Rostaghi & Azami (2016). This step
results in an integer-valued symbol time series ``S = \\{ s_i \\}_{i=1}^N``, where
``s_i \\in [1, 2, \\ldots, c]``.

Next, the symbol time series ``S`` is embedded into an
``m``-dimensional time series, using an embedding lag of ``\\tau = 1``, which yields a
total of ``N - (m - 1)\\tau`` points, or "dispersion patterns". Because each ``z_i`` can
take on ``c`` different values, and each embedding point has ``m`` values, there
are ``c^m`` possible dispersion patterns. This number is used for normalization when
computing dispersion entropy.

### Computing dispersion probabilities and entropy

A probability distribution ``P = \\{p_i \\}_{i=1}^{c^m}``, where
``\\sum_i^{c^m} p_i = 1``, can then be estimated by counting and sum-normalising
the distribution of dispersion patterns among the embedding vectors.
Note that dispersion patterns that are not present are not counted. Therefore, you'll
always get non-zero probabilities using the `Dispersion` probability estimator.

To compute dispersion entropy of order `q` to a given `base` on the
univariate input time series `x`, do:

```julia
entropy_renyi(x, Dispersion(), base = 2, q = 1)
```

## Data requirements and parameters

The input must have more than one unique element for the Gaussian mapping to be
well-defined. Li et al. (2018) recommends that `x` has at least 1000 data points.

If `check_unique == true` (default), then it is checked that the input has
more than one unique value. If `check_unique == false` and the input only has one
unique element, then a `InexactError` is thrown when trying to compute probabilities.

See also: [`entropy_dispersion`](@ref), [`GaussianCDFEncoding`](@ref).

!!! note "Why 'dispersion patterns'?"
    Each embedding vector is called a "dispersion pattern". Why? Let's consider the case
    when ``m = 5`` and ``c = 3``, and use some very imprecise terminology for illustration:

    When ``c = 3``, values clustering far below mean are in one group, values clustered
    around the mean are in one group, and values clustering far above the mean are in a
    third group. Then the embedding vector ``[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`` consists of values that are
    relatively close together (close to the mean), so it represents a set of numbers that
    are not very spread out (less dispersed). The embedding vector ``[1, 1, 2, 3, 3]``,
    however, represents numbers that are much more spread out (more dispersed), because the
    categories representing "outliers" both above and below the mean are represented,
    not only values close to the mean.
