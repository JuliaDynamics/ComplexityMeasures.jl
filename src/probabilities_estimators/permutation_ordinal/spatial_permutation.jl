    SpatialSymbolicPermutation(stencil, x, periodic = true)

A symbolic, permutation-based probabilities estimator for spatiotemporal systems.

The input data `x` are high-dimensional arrays, for example 2D arrays [^Ribeiro2012] or 3D arrays
[^Schlemmer2018]. This approach is also known as _spatiotemporal permutation entropy_.
`x` is given because we need to know its size for optimization and bound checking.

A _stencil_ defines what local area (which points) around each pixel to
consider, and compute ordinal patterns from.
The number of included points in a stencil (`m`) determines the length of the vectors
to be discretized, i.e. there are `m!` possible ordinal patterns around each pixel.

Example usage:
```julia
data = [rand(50, 50) for _ in 1:50]
x = data[1] # first "time slice" of a spatial system evolution
stencil = ...
est = SpatialSymbolicPermutation(stencil, x)
```

Stencils are passed in one of the following three ways:

1. As vectors of `CartesianIndex` which encode the pixels to include in the
    stencil, with respect to the current pixel, or integer arrays of the same dimensionality
    as the data. For example

    ```julia
    stencil = CartesianIndex.([(0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0)])
    ```
    Don't forget to include the zero offset index if you want to include the point itself,
    which is almost always the case.
    Here the stencil creates a 2x2 square extending to the bottom and right of the pixel
    (directions here correspond to the way Julia prints matrices by default).
    When passing a stencil as a vector of `CartesianIndex`, `m = length(stencil)`.

2. As a `D`-dimensional array (where `D` matches the dimensionality of the input data)
    containing `0`s and `1`s, where if `stencil[index] == 1`, the corresponding pixel is
    included, and if `stencil[index] == 0`, it is not included.
    To generate the same estimator as in 1., use

    ```julia
    stencil = [1 1; 1 1]
    ```
    When passing a stencil as a `D`-dimensional array, `m = sum(stencil)`

3. As a `Tuple` containing two `Tuple`s, both of length `D`, for `D`-dimensional data.
    The first tuple specifies the `extent` of the stencil, where `extent[i]`
    dictates the number of pixels to be included along the `i`th axis and `lag[i]`
    the separation of pixels along the same axis.
    This method can only generate (hyper)rectangular stencils. To create the same estimator as
    in the previous examples, use here

    ```julia
    stencil = ((2, 2), (1, 1))
    ```
    When passing a stencil using `extent` and `lag`, `m = prod(extent)!`.

After having defined `est`, one calculates the spatial permutation entropy
by calling [`entropy`](@ref) with `est`, and with the array data.
To apply this to timeseries of spatial data, simply loop over the call, e.g.:

```julia
h = entropy(x, est)
h_vs_t = [entropy(d, est) for d in data]
```

The argument `periodic` decides whether the stencil should wrap around at the end of the
array. If `periodic = false`, pixels whose stencil exceeds the array bounds are skipped.
