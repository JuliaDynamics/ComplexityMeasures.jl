    SpatialSymbolicPermutation(stencil, x, periodic = true)

A symbolic, permutation-based probabilities/entropy estimator for spatiotemporal systems.

The input data `x` are high-dimensional arrays, for example 2D arrays [^Ribeiro2012] or 3D arrays
[^Schlemmer2018]. This approach is also known as _spatiotemporal permutation entropy_.
`x` is given because we need to know its size for optimization and bound checking.

A _stencil_ defines what local area around each pixel to
consider, and compute the ordinal pattern within the stencil. Stencils are given as
vectors of `CartesianIndex` which encode the _offsets_ of the pixes to include in the
stencil, with respect to the current pixel. For example

```julia
data = [rand(50, 50) for _ in 1:50]
x = data[1] # first "time slice" of a spatial system evolution
stencil = CartesianIndex.([(0,1), (1,1), (1,0)])
est = SpatialSymbolicPermutation(stencil, x)
```

Here the stencil creates a 2x2 square extending to the bottom and right of the pixel
(directions here correspond to the way Julia prints matrices by default).
Notice that no offset (meaning the pixel itself) is always included automatically.
The length of the stencil decides the order of the permutation entropy, and the ordering
within the stencil dictates the order that pixels are compared with.
The pixel without any offset is always first in the order.

After having defined `est`, one calculates the spatial permutation entropy
by calling [`entropy`](@ref) with `est`, and with the array data.
To apply this to timeseries of spatial data, simply loop over the call, e.g.:

```julia
entropy = entropy_renyi(x, est)
entropy_vs_time = entropy_renyi.(data, est) # broadcasting with `.`
```

The argument `periodic` decides whether the stencil should wrap around at the end of the
array. If `periodic = false`, pixels whose stencil exceeds the array bounds are skipped.
