    VisitationFrequency(b::AbstractBinning) <: ProbabilitiesEstimator

A probability estimator based on binning data into rectangular boxes dictated by
the binning scheme `b` and then computing the frequencies of points in the bins.

This method has a linearithmic time complexity (`n log(n)` for `n = length(x)`)
and a linear space complexity (`l` for `l = dimension(x)`).
This allows computation of probabilities (histograms) of high-dimensional
datasets and with small box sizes `Îµ` without memory overflow and with maximum performance.
To obtain the bin information along with the probabilities, use [`binhist`](@ref).
