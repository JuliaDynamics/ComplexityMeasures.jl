    ValueHistogram(b::AbstractBinning) <: ProbabilitiesEstimator

A probability estimator based on binning the values of the data as dictated by
the binning scheme `b` and formally computing their histogram, i.e.,
the frequencies of points in the bins. Alias to this is `VisitationFrequency`.

This method has a linearithmic time complexity (`n log(n)` for `n = length(x)`)
and a linear space complexity (`l` for `l = dimension(x)`).
This allows computation of probabilities (histograms) of high-dimensional
datasets and with small box sizes `Îµ` without memory overflow and with maximum performance.

To obtain the bin information along with the probabilities,
use [`probabilities_and_events`](@ref). The events correspond to the bin corners.
