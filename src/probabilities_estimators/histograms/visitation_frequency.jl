    ValueHistogram(b::AbstractBinning) <: ProbabilitiesEstimator

A probability estimator based on binning the values of the data as dictated by
the binning scheme `b` and formally computing their histogram, i.e.,
the frequencies of points in the bins. An alias to this is `VisitationFrequency`.

    ValueHistogram(ϵ::Union{Real,Vector})

A convenience method that accepts same input as [`RectangularBinning`](@ref)
and initializes this binning directly.

The `ValueHistogram` estimator has a linearithmic time complexity
(`n log(n)` for `n = length(x)`) and a linear space complexity (`l` for `l = dimension(x)`).
This allows computation of probabilities (histograms) of high-dimensional
datasets and with small box sizes `ε` without memory overflow and with maximum performance.

# Outcomes

The outcomes `Ω` for `ValueHistogram` is the set of unique bins constructed
from `b`. Each bin is identified by its left (lowest-value) corner.
Use [`probabilities_and_outcomes`](@ref) to obtain bins together
with the probabilities.

See also: [`RectangularBinning`](@ref).
