    fasthist!(x) â†’ c::Vector{Int}

Count the occurrences `c` of the unique data values in `x`,
so that `c[i]` is the number of times the value
`sort!(unique(x))[i]` occurs. Hence, this method is useful mostly when
`x` contains integer or categorical data.

Prior to counting, `x` is sorted, so this function also mutates `x`.
Therefore, it is called with `copy` in higher level API when necessary.
This function works for any `x` for which `sort!(x)` works.
