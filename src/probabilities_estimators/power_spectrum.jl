    PowerSpectrum() <: ProbabilitiesEstimator

Calculate the power spectrum of a timeseries (amplitude square of its Fourier transform),
and return the spectrum normalized to sum = 1 as probabilities.
The Shannon entropy of these probabilities is typically referred in the literature as
_spectral entropy_, e.g. [^Llanos2016],[^Tian2017].

The closer the spectrum is to flat, i.e., white noise, the higher the entropy. However,
you can't compare entropies of timeseries with different length, because the binning
in spectral space depends on the length of the input.

## Outcome space

The outcome space `Ω` for `PowerSpectrum` is the set of frequencies in Fourier space. They
should be multiplied with the sampling rate of the signal, which is assumed to be `1`.
Input `x` is needed for a well-defined [`outcome_space`](@ref).
