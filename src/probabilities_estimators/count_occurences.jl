    CountOccurrences()

A probabilities/entropy estimator based on straight-forward counting of distinct elements in
a univariate time series or multivariate dataset. This is the same as giving no
estimator to [`probabilities`](@ref).

The events in [`probabilities_and_events`](@ref) are the sorted unique values of
the input.
