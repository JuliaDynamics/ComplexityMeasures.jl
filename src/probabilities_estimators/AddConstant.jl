    AddConstant <: ProbabilitiesEstimator
    AddConstant(o::OutcomeSpace, c = 1.0)

A generic add-constant probabilities estimator for counting-based [`OutcomeSpace`](@ref)s,
where several literature estimators can be obtained tuning `c`. Currently ``c``
can only be a scalar.

- `c = 1.0` is the Laplace estimator, or the "add-one" estimator.

## Description

Probabilities for the ``k``-th outcome ``\\omega_{k}`` are estimated as

```math
p(\\omega_k) = \\dfrac{(n_k + c)}{n + mc},
```

where ``m`` is the cardinality of the outcome space, and ``n`` is the number of
(encoded) input data points, and ``n_k`` is the number of times the outcome ``\\omega_{k}``
is observed in the (encoded) input data points.

If the `AddConstant` estimator used with
[`probabilities`](@ref)/[`probabilities_and_outcomes`](@ref),
then ``m`` is set to the number of *observed* outcomes. If used with
[`allprobabilities`](@ref)/[`allprobabilities_and_outcomes`](@ref), then ``m`` is set to
the number of *possible* outcomes.

!!! note "Unobserved outcomes are assigned nonzero probability!"
    Looking at the formula above, if ``n_k = 0``, then unobserved outcomes are assigned
    a non-zero probability of ``\\dfrac{c}{n + mc}``. This means that if the estimator
    is used with [`allprobabilities`](@ref)/[`allprobabilities_and_outcomes`](@ref), then
    all outcomes, even those that are not observed, are assigned non-zero probabilities.
    This might affect your results if using e.g. [`missing_outcomes`](@ref).
