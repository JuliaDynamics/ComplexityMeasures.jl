    ValueHistogram(b::RectangularBinning, x) <: ProbabilitiesEstimator
    ValueHistogram(b::FixedRectangularBinning) <: ProbabilitiesEstimator

A probability estimator based on binning the values of the data as dictated by
the binning scheme `b` and formally computing their histogram, i.e.,
the frequencies of points in the bins. An alias to this is `VisitationFrequency`.
Available binnings are:
- [`RectangularBinning`](@ref)
- [`FixedRectangularBinning`](@ref)

Notice that if not using the fixed binning, `x` (the input data) must also be given
to the estimator, as it is not possible to deduce histogram size only from the binning.

The `ValueHistogram` estimator has a linearithmic time complexity
(`n log(n)` for `n = length(x)`) and a linear space complexity (`l` for `l = dimension(x)`).
This allows computation of probabilities (histograms) of high-dimensional
datasets and with small box sizes `ε` without memory overflow and with maximum performance.
For performance reasons,
the probabilities returned never contain 0s and are arbitrarily ordered.

    ValueHistogram(ϵ::Union{Real,Vector}, x)

A convenience method that accepts same input as [`RectangularBinning`](@ref)
and initializes this binning directly.

## Outcomes

The outcome space for `ValueHistogram` is the unique bins constructed
from `b`. Each bin is identified by its left (lowest-value) corner.
The bins are in data units, not integer (cartesian indices units), and
are returned as `SVector`s.
