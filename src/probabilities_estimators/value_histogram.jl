    ValueHistogram(b::AbstractBinning) <: ProbabilitiesEstimator

A probability estimator based on binning the values of the data as dictated by
the binning scheme `b` and formally computing their histogram, i.e.,
the frequencies of points in the bins. An alias to this is `VisitationFrequency`.
Available binnings are subtypes of [`AbstractBinning`](@ref).

The `ValueHistogram` estimator has a linearithmic time complexity
(`n log(n)` for `n = length(x)`) and a linear space complexity (`l` for `l = dimension(x)`).
This allows computation of probabilities (histograms) of high-dimensional
datasets and with small box sizes `ε` without memory overflow and with maximum performance.
For performance reasons,
the probabilities returned never contain 0s and are arbitrarily ordered.

    ValueHistogram(ϵ::Union{Real,Vector})

A convenience method that accepts same input as [`RectangularBinning`](@ref)
and initializes this binning directly.

## Outcomes

The outcome space for `ValueHistogram` is the unique bins constructed
from `b`. Each bin is identified by its left (lowest-value) corner,
because bins are always left-closed-right-open intervals `[a, b)`.
The bins are in data units, not integer (cartesian indices units), and
are returned as `SVector`s, i.e., same type as input data.

For convenience, [`outcome_space`](@ref)
returns the outcomes in the same array format as the underlying binning
(e.g., `Matrix` for 2D input).

For [`FixedRectangularBinning`](@ref) the [`outcome_space`](@ref) is well-defined from the
binning, but for [`RectangularBinning`](@ref) input `x` is needed as well.
