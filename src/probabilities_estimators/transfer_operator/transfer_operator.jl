    TransferOperator(b::RectangularBinning)

A probability estimator based on binning data into rectangular boxes dictated by
the given binning scheme `b`, then approximating the transfer (Perron-Frobenius) operator
over the bins, then taking the invariant measure associated with that transfer operator
as the bin probabilities. Assumes that the input data are sequential (time-ordered).

This implementation follows the grid estimator approach in Diego et al. (2019)[^Diego2019].

## Outcome space

The outcome space for `TransferOperator` is the set of unique bins constructed
from `b`. Bins are identified by their left (lowest-value) corners, are given in
data units, and are returned as `SVector`s.

## Bin ordering

Bins returned by [`probabilities_and_outcomes`](@ref) are ordered according to first
appearance (i.e. the first time the input (multivariate) timeseries visits the bin).
Thus, if

```julia
b = RectangularBinning(4)
est = TransferOperator(b)
probs, outcomes = probabilities_and_outcomes(x, est) # x is some timeseries
```

then `probs[i]` is the invariant measure (probability) of the bin `outcomes[i]`, which is
the `i`-th bin visited by the timeseries with nonzero measure.

## Description

The transfer operator ``P^{N}``is computed as an `N`-by-`N` matrix of transition
probabilities between the states defined by the partition elements, where `N` is the
number of boxes in the partition that is visited by the orbit/points.

If  ``\\{x_t^{(D)} \\}_{n=1}^L`` are the ``L`` different ``D``-dimensional points over
which the transfer operator is approximated, ``\\{ C_{k=1}^N \\}`` are the ``N`` different
partition elements (as dictated by `ϵ`) that gets visited by the points, and
 ``\\phi(x_t) = x_{t+1}``, then

```math
P_{ij} = \\dfrac
{\\#\\{ x_n | \\phi(x_n) \\in C_j \\cap x_n \\in C_i \\}}
{\\#\\{ x_m | x_m \\in C_i \\}},
```

where ``\\#`` denotes the cardinal. The element ``P_{ij}`` thus indicates how many points
that are initially in box ``C_i`` end up in box ``C_j`` when the points in ``C_i`` are
projected one step forward in time. Thus, the row ``P_{ik}^N`` where
``k \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, N \\}`` gives the probability
of jumping from the state defined by box ``C_i`` to any of the other ``N`` states. It
follows that ``\\sum_{k=1}^{N} P_{ik} = 1`` for all ``i``. Thus, ``P^N`` is a row/right
stochastic matrix.

### Invariant measure estimation from transfer operator

The left invariant distribution ``\\mathbf{\\rho}^N`` is a row vector, where
``\\mathbf{\\rho}^N P^{N} = \\mathbf{\\rho}^N``. Hence, ``\\mathbf{\\rho}^N`` is a row
eigenvector of the transfer matrix ``P^{N}`` associated with eigenvalue 1. The distribution
``\\mathbf{\\rho}^N`` approximates the invariant density of the system subject to
`binning`, and can be taken as a probability distribution over the partition elements.

In practice, the invariant measure ``\\mathbf{\\rho}^N`` is computed using
[`invariantmeasure`](@ref), which also approximates the transfer matrix. The invariant
distribution is initialized as a length-`N` random distribution which is then applied to
``P^{N}``.
The resulting length-`N` distribution is then applied to ``P^{N}`` again. This process
repeats until the difference between the distributions over consecutive iterations is
below some threshold.

The `N`-by-`N` matrix `to` is an approximation to the transfer operator, subject to the
given `binning`, computed over some set of sequentially ordered points.

For convenience, `mini` and `edgelengths` provide the minima and box edge lengths along
each coordinate axis, as determined by applying `ϵ` to the points. The coordinates of
the (leftmost, if axis is ordered low-high) box corners are given in `bins`.

Only bins actually visited by the points are considered, and `bins` give the coordinates
of these bins. The element `bins[i]` correspond to the `i`-th state of the system, which
corresponds to the `i`-th column/row of the transfer operator `to`.

`sort_idxs` contains the indices that would sort the input points. `visitors` is a
vector of vectors, where `visitors[i]` contains the indices of the (sorted)
points that visits `bins[i]`.

!!! hint "Transfer operator approach vs. naive histogram approach"

    Why bother with the transfer operator instead of using regular histograms to obtain
    probabilities?

    In fact, the naive histogram approach and the
    transfer operator approach are equivalent in the limit of long enough time series
    (as ``n \\to \\intfy``), which is guaranteed by the ergodic theorem. There is a crucial
    difference, however:

    The naive histogram approach only gives the long-term probabilities that
    orbits visit a certain region of the state space. The transfer operator encodes that
    information too, but comes with the added benefit of knowing the *transition
    probabilities* between states (see [`transfermatrix`](@ref)).
